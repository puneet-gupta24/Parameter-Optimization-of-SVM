## Parameter Optimization of SVM
## SVM
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm that can be used for both linear and nonlinear classification tasks, as well as for regression tasks.

## Parameter Optimization

Parameter optimization, also known as hyperparameter tuning, refers to the process of selecting the best set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model to achieve optimal performance. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the learning process begins and control the behavior of the learning algorithm.

## Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains a total of 2278 instances with 10 attributes.
